# Tutorial: Intro to React

[Learn by doing](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html): The note is based on this.

[step-by-step guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html): Learn concepts from the ground up.

## Before We Start the Tutorial

Build a small game.

*learn by doing*

Four parts:

- Setup for the Tutorial
- Overview
- Completing the Game
- Adding Time Travel

### What Are We Building?

Build an **interactive tic-tac-toe game**.

The Final Result is like [this](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010).

### Prerequisites

If you are familiar with **HTNL** and **JavaScript** may be better, but they are not necessary.

You should be familiar with basic programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.

**Remark:** We will use some features from **ES6** --- a recent version of JavaScript. Use [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?presets=react&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBApgGzgWzmWBeGAeAFgRgD4AJRBEAGhgHcQAnBAEwEJsB6AwgbgChRJY_KAEMAlmDh0YWRiGABXVOgB0AczhQAokiVQAQgE8AkowAUAcjogQUcwEpeAJTjDgUACIB5ALLK6aRklTRBQ0KCohMQk6Bx4gA) to check what **ES6** code compiles to.

## Setup for the Tutorial

### Setup Option 1: Write Code in the Browser

[Starter Code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010): This tab diaplay an wmpty tic-tac-toe game board and React code.

### Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment

**Important!** ðŸ˜Š

Install `Node.js`

`Create React App`

delete the files in `/src` folder and replace them

use `npm starter` to open the browser

Configure syntax highlighting for editor

### Help, I'm Stuck!

If you get stuck, check out the [community support resources](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html).

Also, [Reactiflux Chat](https://discord.com/invite/reactiflux) is a great way to get help quidkly.

If remaining stuck, **file an issue**.

## Overview

### What Is React?

`React` is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for **building user interfaces**. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called `components`.

Start from `React.Component` subclasses

We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.

```react
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhatsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />
```

ShoppingList is a **React Component class**, or **React component type**. A component takes in parameters, called `props` (short for "properties").

The `render` method returns a *description* of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the decription adn displays the result.

In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render.

Use a special syntax called "JSX" which makes these structures easier to write, i.e. transform the `<div />` syntax to `React.createElement('div')`. The example above is equivalent to:

```react
return React.createElement('div', {calssName: 'shopping-list'},
	React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
    React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
);
```

```react
/*#__PURE__*/
React.createElement("div", {
    calssName: "shopping-list"
}, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("ul", null,
/*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("li", null, "Instagram"),
/*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("li", null, "WhatsApp"),
/*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("li", null, "Oculus")));
```

What does the `/*#__PURE__*/` tag means?

[The pure function in JavaScript.](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)

- A **pure function** is a function which given the same input, always returns the same output. It produces no side effects.
- `/*#__PURE__*/` is and indication that the function in question is pure, or be more precise, side-effect free. This helps with [tree-shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) - the removal of dead code from bundles when nothing else references a particular value. reference: [What's the meaning of /\*#\__PURE\__\*/ in some JaveScript source code?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68187576/whats-the-meaning-of-pure-in-some-javascript-source-code)

More detail for `createElement()` in the [API reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement).

JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. Each React element is a JavaScript object that can be stored in a variable of pass around in program.

[JavaScript HTML DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)

[HTML \<div> tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP): The `<div>` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. It is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

[HTML \<li> tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_li.asp): The `<li>` tag is used inside ordered lists(`<ol>`), unordered lists(`<ul>`), and in menu lists(`<menu>`). 

We can compose and render custom React components. For example, we can now refer to the whole shopping list by writing `<ShoppingList />`. Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently. 

### Inspecting the Starter Code

Inspect the `index.js` file

There are three React components: Squre, Board, Game.

The Squqre component renders a single `<button>` and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we'll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.

### Passing Data Through Props

Try to pass some data from Board component to Square component.

Pass a *prop* from a parent Board component to a child Square component.

### Making an Interactive Component

Fill the Square component with an "X" when click it.

Use [devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) console to track the click.

[Arrow function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions):

- An **arrow function expression** is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited.
- Arrow functions don't have their bindings to `this`, `arguments` or `super`, and should not be used as `methods`.

Components use **state** to remember things.

React components can have state by setting `this.state` in their constructors. `this.state` should be considered as private to a React component that it's defined in. Store the current value of the Square in `this.state`, and change it when the Square is clicked.

Add a **Constructor** to the class to initialize the state.

**Remark:** In `JavaScript` classes, you need to always call `super` when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a `constructor` should start with a `super(props)` call.

### Developer Tools

[React Developer Tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

Inspect a React component tree with browser's tools (in `Component` tag).



## Completing the Game



## Lifting State Up

We need to maintain the value of each of the 9 squares in one location.

**Declare the shared state in their parent component**

The parent component can pass the state back down to the children by using **props**, and keep the child components **in  sync** with each other and with the parent component.
